# leetCodeSolutions
These are all my (correct and in progress) solutions to the problems on leetCode.com

My solutions have only one constraint - solving time.

My only concern when coming up with solutionsis how quickly I can solve them.  
In this sense, this repo is like my mental gym where I come in 
early in the mornings for thirty minutes and do as much as I can.

These solutions were solved using the IDEAL problem solving method and the Duke Univ.'s
approach to solving computer science problems.

ps. Naming scheme for files in the repo
(number of question on leetcode) (leetcode title of prob)

Feel free to leave comments! I welcome them all!
Thanks for visitings!
Sending you good vibes,
Checo
